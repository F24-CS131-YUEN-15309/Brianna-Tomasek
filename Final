Description:
My project discussed Drug discovery and molecular modeling, what each is separately and together, its current progress, its current challenges, and what it is overall. 
I break down each part individually and then stack each part onto the next to smoothly transition the viewer to a clearer understanding. In my project, I use short concise
bullet points for basic knowledge on each part to not create too much length or difficulty grasping the subjects. Each slide also has a picture to go along with the topic to 
show visual learners an idea of the concepts and how they work. I finished the project with an overall page to simplify everything even more and a reference page to show where 
I had sourced my information.
